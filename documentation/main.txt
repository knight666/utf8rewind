@section introduction Introduction

`utf8rewind` is a C library designed to extend default string handling functions in order to add support for UTF-8 encoded text. Besides providing functions to deal with UTF-8 encoded text, it also provides functions for converting to and from UTF-16 encoded text, the default on Windows.

For a full summary of the interface, please click [here](@ref utf8rewind.h).

@section why-utf8 Why UTF-8?

UTF-8 encoded Unicode accounts for [over 60 percent of the web](http://googleblog.blogspot.nl/2012/02/unicode-over-60-percent-of-web.html). And with good reason! Because UTF-8 is completely backwards-compatible with ASCII, developers only need to change code dealing with codepoints. UTF-8 can encode the full range of Unicode codepoints in a maximum of six bytes per codepoint. However, because most text tends to be the Latin alphabet mixed with special characters, the common case is strings not much longer than pure ASCII.

@section why-not-utf16 Why not UTF-16?

UTF-16 encoding solves the same problems as UTF-8, but in a different way. UTF-16 is not backwards-compatible with ASCII, resulting in invalid codepoints being encountered when the string is treated as ASCII. As a result, all code dealing with strings must be changed in order to handle these new strings. This can be seen in the changes made in the C strings API:

Description                | ASCII   | UTF-16
-------------------------- | ------- | ------
Get the length of a string | strlen  | wcslen
Copy a string to another   | strcpy  | wcscpy
Append to a string         | strcat  | wcscat
Convert to lowercase       | tolower | towlower

Converting a project to use UTF-16 after the fact is a serious endeavour that touches *all* code dealing with strings. On the other hand, changing existing code to use UTF-8 only deals with codepoint processing.

@section examples Examples

@subsection example-changes Changes to existing code

Suppose you maintain a client application written in C. In order for clients to login, the application needs to check their credentials. This is accomplished by the following function:

@code{.c}
	int Login_CheckCredentials(const char* username, const char* password)
	{
		const char* salt;
		const char* hashed_password;
		char verify_password[256];
		char hashed_verify_password[256];

		memset(verify_password, 0, 256);
		/* For the purposes of brevity, ignore the fact
		that this is a terrible way to generate a salt,
		because it has insufficient entropy. */
		salt = md5(username);
		hashed_password = md5(password);
		strcat(verify_password, hashed_password);
		strcat(verify_password, salt);

		memset(hashed_verify_password, 0, 256);
		strcpy(hashed_verify_password, md5(verify_password));

		return Database_CheckLogin(username, hashed_verify_password);
	}
@endcode

Now we want to improve our security by allowing the full range of Unicode in the passwords by using UTF-8 encoding.

What would we have to change? The answer is: nothing.

A password like \"M&ocirc;ntiPyth&ocirc;nikdenH&ocirc;lieGr&acirc;ilen\" would be encoded as "M\xF8Pyth\xF8denH\xF8Gr\xE4en", meaning the calls to `strcat` and `strcpy` would still work as intended. The password can be treated as ASCII without changing the code.

When converting your project to use UTF-8, you only have to worry about two surface area's: input and display. Let's look at those separately.

@subsection example-user-input Dealing with user input

Continuing with the previous example, the old password field accepted only ASCII input:

@code{.c}
	static const int g_PasswordInputMaximum = 255;
	static char g_PasswordInput[g_PasswordInputMaximum + 1];

	int PasswordField_EnterCharacter(char input)
	{
		char text_input[2];
		text_input[0] = input;
		text_input[1] = 0;
		
		if (strlen(g_PasswordInput) + 1 > g_PasswordInputMaximum)
		{
			return 0;
		}
		
		strcat(g_PasswordInput, text_input);

		return 1;
	}
@endcode

We'll have to make sure that we provide UTF-32 codepoints instead:

@code{.c}
	int PasswordField_EnterCharacter(unicode_t input)
@endcode

This can be accomplished using a simple cast, because all Unicode codepoints fit in a `unicode_t` type.

Next, we'll have to increase the size of the `text_input` string in order to accommodate the conversion of the codepoint to UTF-8:

@code{.c}
	char text_input[16];
	memset(text_input, 0, 16);
	
	if (utf8encode(input, text_input, 16) <= 0)
	{
		return 0;
	}
@endcode

Because the codepoint can consist of multiple characters, we'll have to change the check to see if we're not overflowing the password input string:

@code{.c}
	if (strlen(g_PasswordInput) + strlen(text_input) > g_PasswordInputMaximum)
	{
		return 0;
	}
@endcode

Finally, putting it all together:

@code{.c}
	static const int g_PasswordInputMaximum = 255;
	static char g_PasswordInput[g_PasswordInputMaximum + 1];

	int PasswordField_EnterCharacter(unicode_t input)
	{
		char text_input[16];
		memset(text_input, 0, 16);
		
		if (utf8encode(input, text_input, 16) <= 0)
		{
			return 0;
		}
		
		if (strlen(g_PasswordInput) + strlen(text_input) > g_PasswordInputMaximum)
		{
			return 0;
		}
		
		strcat(g_PasswordInput, text_input);

		return 1;
	}
@endcode

With a few changes, the password field now accepts UTF-8 input. The benefit here is that we didn't need to change the algorithm itself, only the input had to be converted.

@subsection example-display Displaying Unicode usernames

One problem remains: the user may be able to *enter* Unicode characters in text fields, but they won't show up right.

Let's look at the offending function:

@code{.c}
	void InputField_Draw(int x, int y, const char* text)
	{
		size_t i;
		const char* src = text;
		
		FontBatch_Start("Arial20");
		
		for (i = 0; i < strlen(text); ++i)
		{
			FontBatch_AddCharacter(*src);
			
			src++;
		}
		
		FontBatch_End();
		FontBatch_Draw(x, y);
	}
@endcode

The first thing that will have to change is that `FontBatch_AddCharacter` should accept UTF-32 codepoints. Fortunately, that change is backwards-compatible:

@code{.c}
	FontBatch_AddCharacter((unicode_t)*src);
@endcode

Next, we'll have to treat the input as UTF-8 encoded text. We'll have to read codepoints one-by-one.

@code{.c}
	unicode_t codepoint;
	size_t i;
	int offset;
	const char* src = text;
	
	for (i = 0; i < utf8len(text); ++i)
	{
		offset = utf8decode(src, &codepoint);
		if (offset <= 0)
		{
			break;
		}
		
		src += offset;
	}
@endcode

Putting it all together again:

@code{.c}
	void InputField_Draw(int x, int y, const char* text)
	{
		unicode_t codepoint;
		size_t i;
		int offset;
		const char* src = text;
		
		FontBatch_Start("Arial20");
		
		for (i = 0; i < utf8len(text); ++i)
		{
			offset = utf8decode(src, &codepoint);
			if (offset <= 0)
			{
				break;
			}
			
			FontBatch_AddCharacter(codepoint);
			
			src += offset;
		}
		
		FontBatch_End();
		FontBatch_Draw(x, y);
	}
@endcode

@section building Building utf8rewind

Use [GYP](http://code.google.com/p/gyp/) to generate a project, like so:

	tools/gyp/gyp --depth --format=msvs2010 utf8rewind.gyp

After generating a solution, build and run the "tests" project. Verify that all tests pass on your system before continuing.

@note The project has only been tested as compiling and running using Visual Studio 2010 on Windows, but GYP should generate workable output for other platforms as well.

@subsection integration Integrating with your own project

The recommended way to integrate `utf8rewind` is to link to the static library you compiled. Of course, because the library consists of only two files, the header and source can also be included directly.

@section helping-out Helping out

As a user, you can help the project in a number of ways, in order of difficulty:

* **Use it** - Interface designers such as myself often have very different ideas about usability than those actually using it. By using the library, you are helping the project spread and could potentially improve it by taking your project into consideration.

* **Spread the word** - If you find `utf8rewind` useful, recommend it to your friends and coworkers.

* **Complain** - No library is perfect and `utf8rewind` is no exception. If you find a fault but lack the means (time, resources, etc.) to fix it, sending complaints to the proper channels can help the project out a lot.

* **Write a failing test** - If a feature is not working as intended, you can prove it by writing a failing test. By sending the test to us, we can make the adjustments necessary for it to pass.

* **Write a patch** - Patches include a code change that help tests to pass. A patch must always include a set of tests that fail to pass without the patch. All patches will be reviewed and possibly cleaned up before being accepted.*/
